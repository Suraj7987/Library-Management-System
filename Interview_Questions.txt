1. What is normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

2. Explain primary vs foreign key.
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. A foreign key refers to a primary key in another table to create a relationship.

3. What are constraints?
Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY).

4. What is a surrogate key?
A surrogate key is a system-generated unique identifier (e.g., auto-incremented ID) used as a primary key.

5. How do you avoid data redundancy?
Using normalization and relationships (foreign keys) to structure data efficiently.

6. What is ER diagram?
An Entity-Relationship Diagram visually represents entities, attributes, and relationships in a database.

7. What are the types of relationships in DBMS?
One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many.

8. Explain the purpose of AUTO_INCREMENT.
It automatically generates a unique number when a new record is inserted, usually used for primary keys.

9. What is the default storage engine in MySQL?
InnoDB is the default storage engine in modern MySQL versions.

10. What is a composite key?
A composite key is made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record.
