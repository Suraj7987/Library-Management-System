1. Difference between NULL and 0?
NULL means 'no value', while 0 is a defined numeric value.

2. What is a default constraint?
It provides a default value if no value is supplied during insert.

3. How does IS NULL work?
It checks if a column contains a NULL value: `WHERE column IS NULL`.

4. How do you update multiple rows?
By using `UPDATE` with a `WHERE` condition matching multiple rows.

5. Can we insert partial values?
Yes, if other columns allow NULL or have default values.

6. What happens if a NOT NULL field is left empty?
The query fails with an error due to constraint violation.

7. How do you rollback a deletion?
By using `ROLLBACK` if inside a transaction and not yet committed.

8. Can we insert values into specific columns only?
Yes, by specifying the column list in the `INSERT` statement.

9. How to insert values using SELECT?
Use `INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2) SELECT colA, colB FROM other_table;`

10. What is ON DELETE CASCADE?
It automatically deletes child rows when the referenced parent row is deleted.
